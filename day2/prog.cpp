    -------------------
    Notes on the Program:

    1. Header File:
        - `#include<iostream>` includes the standard input/output stream library, which provides functionality for reading from and writing to the console using `cin` and `cout`.

    2. Namespace:
        - `using namespace std;` allows you to use standard library objects (like `cout`, `cin`, `endl`) without prefixing them with `std::`.

    3. Main Function:
        - `int main()` is the entry point of every C++ program. Execution starts from here.

    4. Variable Declaration:
        - `int a, b;` declares two integer variables to store user input.

    5. Input/Output:
        - `cout << "Enter two numbers: ";` displays a prompt to the user.
        - `cin >> a >> b;` reads two integers from the user and stores them in `a` and `b`.

    6. Calculation and Output:
        - `cout << "multiply is:: " << a * b << endl;` calculates the product of `a` and `b` and displays the result.

    7. Program Termination:
        - `return 0;` signals successful program completion to the operating system.

    This program demonstrates basic C++ concepts: input/output, variable declaration, arithmetic operations, and program structure.
